So you're doing a very important phylogenomics and you've designed or chosen your target set for your favorite organism. What next? Well, you've also got some genomic shotgun sequence data for some closely related species. Rather than moving forward with your sequencing project and hoping for decent recovery without too many nasty paralogs, it's possible to use that WGS data to make life for your future self a little easier, while also improving the efficiency of your project.

This repo provides methods for using WGS data to vet (i.e. filter) your target set prior to bait design.
